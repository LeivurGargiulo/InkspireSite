# Fix 404 Page Not Found Error on Vercel Deployment

## 🐛 Bug Fix: Resolve 404 Page Not Found Error

### Problem
The InkspireAi landing page was returning a 404 'Page not found' error when deployed on Vercel. This was preventing users from accessing the site.

### Root Cause
The issue was caused by an incorrect redirect rule in `vercel.json`:

```json
{
  "rewrites": [
    { "source": "/(.*)", "destination": "/index.html" }
  ]
}
```

This redirect rule was designed for Single Page Applications (SPAs) with client-side routing, but our Astro site generates static HTML files. The redirect was interfering with Vercel's static file serving.

### Solution
Removed the problematic redirect rule from `vercel.json`. The site now uses the correct static deployment configuration:

- ✅ Build command: `npm run build`
- ✅ Publish directory: `dist`
- ✅ Security headers for protection
- ✅ Cache headers for performance

### Testing
- ✅ Dependencies installed successfully
- ✅ Build completes without errors
- ✅ All assets generated correctly
- ✅ Local testing confirms site serves with HTTP 200
- ✅ CSS and JavaScript assets load properly

### Impact
- 🚀 Fixes the 404 error on Vercel deployment
- 🚀 Ensures users can access the InkspireAi landing page
- 🚀 Maintains all existing functionality and styling
- 🚀 No breaking changes to the site structure

### Files Changed
- `vercel.json` - Removed problematic redirect rule

### Deployment
This fix will resolve the 404 error immediately upon deployment to Vercel.
